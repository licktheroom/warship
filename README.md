## Warship v0.0.1
A strategy game inspired by the Atari 2600. Not inspired by Battleship.  
This game also has no textures as an added challenge.  
Only Linux is supported right now.
## Build
### Linux
You need: 
 
* GCC or CLANG
* Opengl deleopment files
* git

Clone this repository by doing: `git clone https://github.com/licktheroom/warship-opengl.git`  
Move into the warship directory, and run `make` then run the executable created by doing `./warship`.
### Windows
I know it's possible to build on Windows, but support at this stage is not promised.
